## BOOTSTRAP
Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Let’s start with a basic template then build off it with components and code snippets to customize our own website.

1. Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to the [Bootstrap examples website](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/).

2.	Try adding some of the following elements to your website from the.

| Feature  |  Type |  Function |
|---|---|---|
| [Navbar](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/navbars/)  |  Component | Navigation header  |
|  [Jumbotron](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/jumbotron/) | Component  |  Showcase key content |
|  [Typography](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/content/typography/) | CSS  | Different ways of displaying text  |
|[Grid System](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/) |  CSS |  Utilize 12-column system of Bootstrap to divide up your content |
|  [Responsive Helpers](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/utilities/responsive-helpers/) | Component  |  For documents, videos, etc. |
|  [ScrollSpy](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/scrollspy/) |  JavaScript | Enables functionality for the Navbar  |

## CSS
1.	In Visual Studio Code, open the file `main.css`. 
	This is being referenced in the `index.html` file by the line: 

    `<link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`


3.	Add CSS code to `main.css` to assign style elements to tags or containers in your index.html file. Don’t forget to use a class selector (.containername) to apply style to classes. Example (.jumbotron) below:
    ```css
    body {     
        position: relative;
    } 

    .jumbotron {
        background-color: lightblue; 
    }

    h1 {    
        font-family: Georgia;
        text-align: center;     
        font-style: italic;
        padding-top: 50px; 
    } 
    
    p {     
        font-family: Arial;     
        font-size: 20px;     
    } 
    ```
